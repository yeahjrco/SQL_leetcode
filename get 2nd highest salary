Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

Answer 1:
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) 
RETURNS INT

DETERMINISTIC

BEGIN
    # if find 2nd record, means Limit 1,1 (start row, next 1 row)
    Set N = N-1;
  RETURN (
    # Write your MySQL query statement below.
    Select Distinct (Salary)
    from Employee order by Salary DESC
    Limit N,1
        );
END


Answer 2: Make used of DENSE_RANK() to get the rank of each record from its partition

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) 
RETURNS INT

DETERMINISTIC

BEGIN
    
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
    Select Distinct (Salary) from
      (Select Id,Salary,DENSE_RANK() Over (order by Salary DESC) AS nth_salary
        from Employee) As Rank_table
    Where Rank_table.nth_salary = N
        );
END
