Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

Answer:
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select Distinct Log1.Num As ConsecutiveNums
from Logs Log1 inner Join Logs Log2 
on Log1.Id = Log2.Id-1 
inner Join Logs Log3
on Log2.Id = Log3.Id-1 
Where Log1.Num = Log2.Num
And Log2.Num = Log3.Num;
