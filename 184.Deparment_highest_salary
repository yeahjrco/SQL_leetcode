The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
The Department table holds all departments of the company.

+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation:

Answer 1:

Select h.Department, h.Employee,h.Salary
from

E.Name As Employee,
E.Salary As Salary,
DENSE_RANK() Over(Partition by E.DepartmentId order by E.Salary DESC) As Ranks
from Employee E join Department D
on E.DepartmentId = D.Id) As h
where h.Ranks = 1;

Answer 2:

Select D.Name As Department, E.Name As Employee, E.Salary
from Department D join Employee E
